				<div class="para">Contaminated drinking water is as deadly as bullets and bombs. Unsafe drinking water is the cause of about 10% of all the diseases and the reason of 1/3 of deaths in the developing countries. Contaminated drinking water spreads diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid and polio. Over 8 lakhs of people across the world die from diarrhoea because of unsafe drinking water. According to the World Bank, unsafe water and poor sanitation, results in 5% loss in the GDP of developing countries. About 10% of adult productive time is lost due to water related diseases. It is estimated that an investment of rupees 100 crore in drinking water will give a return of rupees 700 crore annually.</div>
				<div class="para">SUJALAM CLEANTECH is a company/entity formed to address this grave concern regarding safe drinking water and to make sure every household has access to safe drinking water. This is achieved through periodic cleaning and sanitisation of drinking water storage tanks. SUJALAM has created a framework and process to ensure every drinking water storage tank in the region to be cleaned every three months. </div>

				<div class="para">Access to clean drinking water is one of most basic necessities for any household. It is indispensable for overall development of society. United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) ensures availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, confirms the importance of water and sanitation in the global political agenda. It addresses the sustainability of water and sanitation access by focusing on the quality, availability and management of freshwater resources.</div>
				<div class="para">The stagnant water in this overhead tanks are more susceptible to contamination and with the passage of time; sediments and algae get deposited on the walls, ceiling and floor of the water tank. This deposition contaminates the water and makes is unfit for use. With time algae and bacteria grow and breed in this water eventually creating various kinds of health issues and diseases. </div>
				<ul class="sec-pt2">
					<li><b>Acanthamoeba</b>, serious eye infections which can lead to blindness</li>
					<li><b>Keraratitis</b> or inflammation of the cornea</li>
					<li><b>Swimmer’s</b> ear which includes symptoms such as swelling, pain, discharge and difficulty in hearing</li>
					<li><b>Legionnaires’</b> disease which has flu-like symptoms</li>
					<li>Dandruff, hair fall and other scalp infections</li>
					<li><b>Crohn’s</b> disease, a digestive disease that cause nausea, diarrhoea and fatigue</li>
					<li>Skin allergies and irritation</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="para">Hence, periodic cleaning of water tank is very important. Overhead water storage tanks have to be cleaned using high-tech equipment for deep cleaning and sanitised to prevent further contamination.</div>
				<div class="para">Cleaning water tanks regularly will help prevent algae from lining the interior and keep sediments from building up at the bottom of the tank. It will also limit disease-carrying insects and vermin from residing in the tank. Clean water tank will maintain water quality, colour and smell.</div>
				<div class="para">Currently, the usual technique of cleaning the water storage tanks is to drain out the tank water through one or more taps located at the bottom portion of the tank. A worker then gets into the tank and scours the walls and bottom using cleanser like disinfectants, caustic soda or other chemicals along with water. As most of the tanks have the water outlet an inch or so above the bottom surface of the tank, water is not completely drained from the tank. The remaining water is removed using a water soaking material like sponge to remove the dirty water before cleaning the bottom of the tank.</div>
				<div class="para">This method of cleaning is tedious and time consuming task, with more effort and labour involved when it comes to cleaning overhead water tanks of huge capacities usually in millions of litres that caters one or more villages. The cost of cleaning is high making it economically non-viable. </div>
